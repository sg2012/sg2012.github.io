### Etc.

You'll find things here that interest me and that I like making, such as video game reviews, short stories, essays.

### Somagenesis

My first novel, *Somagenesis*, began based off of particularly memorable dream imagery.  And of course, my favorite: bizarre descriptions of erratic megastructures and biomechanical pestilence infecting blood.  That which cannot be understood, horrors which lurk outside the boundaries of the thin membrane separating us from the cause of calamity.

My work attempts to probe the relationship between our own consciousness and reality as well as what it means to derive meaning (or discover a nauseating dearth) from suffering and ruin.

When *Somagenesis* is complete, my only hope is that the story of Svea, a woman haunted by her abusive past and consumed with genocidal hatred can make at least one person other than myself think or feel something.  A transmission of viscerality.

### Interests

Biohorror/biopunk, cyberhorror, colossal creatures, specialized operation units, mentally ill characters, primal anger, uncontained trauma spilling out, disintegration and decay, visceral transmission, gore, the atrocity of over-integration and over-reliance on technology/cybernetics, conflict with massive entities that seek to dominate, rebirth, actualizing, somatic and psyche transformation, post-apocalyptic settings, and excruciating questions that will never have an answer.

I like barren, once-inhabited hellscapes that are decaying.  I like the idea of a single person walking through such areas.  I cannot stand the sight of other people.

### Support

If you like what I write and you'd like to show it by leaving a small donation, I won't stop you.  You'll never see ads on my websites, either.  I fucking hate ads.
