### Etc.

You'll find things here that interest me and that I like creating, such as video game reviews, short stories, essays.

### Somagenesis

I began writing because the impulse arose like an explosion. My intense, vivid dreams, my love for story-driven video games and books, my fascination for dark, post-apocalyptic worlds all culminated to an obvious answer.  It had to come out.

My first work *Somagenesis* began based off of particularly memorable dream imagery combined with a slew of additional lies to make it a plausible story with actual substance.  And of course, my favorite: bizarre descriptions of erratic megastructures and biomechanical pestilence infecting blood.  That which cannot be understood, horrors which lurk outside the boundaries of perception.

My work and interests attempt to probe the relationship between our own consciousness and reality as well as what it means to derive meaning (or discover a nauseating dearth) from suffering and destruction. My own struggles with mental health and the questions I've faced in my life inadvertently arise and are given space to process and cycle anew.

When *Somagenesis* is complete, my only hope is that the story of Svea, a woman haunted by her abusive past and consumed with genocidal hatred can make at least one person other than myself think or feel something.  A transmission of viscerality.

### Interests

Biohorror/biopunk, cyberhorror, colossal creatures, specialized operation units, mentally ill characters, primal anger, uncontained trauma spilling out, disintegration and decay, visceral transmission, gore, the atrocity of over-integration and over-reliance on technology/cybernetics, conflict with massive entities that seek to dominate, rebirth, actualizing, somatic and psyche transformation, post-apocalyptic settings, and excruciating questions that will never have an answer.

I like barren, once-inhabited hellscapes that are decaying.  I like the idea of a single person walking through such areas.  I cannot stand the sight of other people.

### Support

If you like what I write and you'd like to show it by leaving a small donation, I won't stop you.  You'll never see ads on my websites, either.  I fucking hate ads.
