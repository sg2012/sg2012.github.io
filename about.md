### Delegated Generalized Space

You'll find things here that interest me and that I like creating, such as video game reviews, short stories, essays.

### Somagenesis

I began writing because the impulse arose like an undeniable truth. My intense, vivid dreams, my love for story-driven video games and books, my fascination for dark, post-apocalyptic worlds all culminated to an obvious answer: I had to begin writing something of my own.

Thus, my first work *Somagenesis* began based off of particularly memorable dream imagery combined with a slew of additional lies to make it a plausible story with actual substance.  And of course, my favorite: bizarre descriptions of erratic megastructures and biomechanical pestilence infecting blood.  That which cannot be understood, horrors which lurk outside the boundaries of perception.

My work and interests attempt to probe the relationship between our own consciousness and reality as well as what it means to derive meaning (or discover a nauseating dearth) from suffering and destruction. My own struggles with mental health and the questions I've faced in my life inadvertently arise and are given space to process and cycle anew.

When *Somagenesis* is complete, my only hope is that the story of Svea, a woman haunted by her abusive past and consumed with hatred in a world where the human species is quickly going extinct from a predatorial entity can make at least one person other than myself think or feel something.  A transmission of viscerality.

In the near future, you can check out a novella I've written called *Obstinance,* which is a first-person log account of Dr. Samantha Reeves, a neuroscientist who played a role in Svea's childhood.  I plan to post it here eventually.

### Interests

My conceptual and literary interests span biohorror/biopunk, cyberhorror, colossal creatures, war, new weird, incomprehensibility, specialized operation units, overly dramatic characters, trauma, disintegration, gore, the atrocity of over-integration and reliance on technology and cybernetics, conflict with massive entities that seek to control, rebirth, actualizing, and self-transformation.

### Support

If you like what I write and you'd like to show it by leaving a small donation, I won't stop you.  You'll never see ads on my websites, either.  I fucking hate ads.
