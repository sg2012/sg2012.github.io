I'm not entirely sure how this is going to come out given that I hardly remember the last time I wrote a review.  There came a point where I no longer wanted to expose what was inside to the outside, including my own perception of whatever I was experiencing.  Why bother?  Finishing Requiem gave me reason to write a review again; it's not very often I manage to finish a video game these days.  Most of them are bland and I feel no desire to, I simply uninstall.  Depression can't be the sole cause of everything.

I remember when I played the first Plague Tale.  It must've been back in October or November of 2019.  I certainly remember that it was fall, at the very least.  The game was so good that I'd think about it all day at work and then make my way home through the colorful leaves and crisp cool air to play it.  I was enthralled, and I even noted on my last review that a game hasn't captured me like that since I was a kid.

I've changed immeasurably these past few years.  In some ways I can hardly recognize the person I was when I played the first game.  Unlike me, A Plague Tale has not changed.

Here still stands a testament to undying will in the face of endless suffering fueled by a desire to protect the one you love.
