Collages composed of images you are drawn to can showcase your instinctual preferences in the Enneagram and your "expanded instincts" in the Attitudinal Psyche system.

These are a collection of some collages I've created.  At first I was oblivious of where to get images that were satisfying to me, so I had to opt for art I was already familiar with in Manga or AI art generation.

Eventually, I made a pinterest and began refining my algorithm to get pictures that captured what I like more.  True to myself, I thought discovering Pinterest was some revolutionary breakthrough, but I had been left behind long ago.
