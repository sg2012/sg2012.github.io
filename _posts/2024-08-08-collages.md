Collages composed of images you are drawn to can showcase your instinctual preferences in typology systems.

These are a collection of some I've created.  At first I was oblivious of where to get images that were satisfying to me, so I had to opt for art I was already familiar with in Manga, Anime, or Games.

Eventually, I made a pinterest and began refining my algorithm to get pictures that captured a more refined aesthetic and allowed me to create certain ideas.  True to myself, I thought discovering Pinterest was some revolutionary breakthrough, but it turned out that I was the last one aboard.
