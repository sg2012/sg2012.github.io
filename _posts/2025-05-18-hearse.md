A smile had not graced the mother’s lips since the child was born nine months ago.

The pit of despair had festered into every crevice of her life.  It was made incarnate each waking moment, taking shape through the interaction of the physical and emotional, becoming something much greater, a force that extended beyond the tangible reality of their situation.

It haunted the gray and malnourished strands of hair, the splintered wood in the corners of the ceiling being eaten away by termites, the bleeding pox on the child’s face that oozed in hopelessness.  It was ever-present.  Suffocating.  It made her choke in the morning, made her spit bloody phlegm into her rusted sink and slither down the drains alongside gray water.

She forgot who she was before this had happened.  Her identity was fractured like a bone, split into a million pieces.  But it was worth it.  She knew no other way.

Love alone was not enough.  What she felt for the child transcended love.  It’s what forced her to wake each morning with fervor despite her miserable depression and withering body.  She was dying with each step alongside her beloved who meant the world to her and more.

The illness of the child came with a predetermined end.  The doctor in the village informed her that the child would not see his first year’s birthday.  No one knew what exactly the affliction was, but it meant that the child could not see the sunlight.  It meant that the child could not hold hands with his mother and breathe in the fresh air of the outside and see the colorful, blooming flowers of the spring.

It meant that they were confined in their dark prison.

The days passed like murky, congealing blood.  A slog, a long march of death.

The rooms had just enough candlelight to make out the dusty particulates floating in the air.  But no light was required to glimpse the bludgeoning dysphoria.  It assaulted the senses like a hammer.  Life was beat down and flattened in the confines of this space.

Nightmares and reality blended together in the mother’s confusing and volatile existence.  She knew not whether she had drifted to sleep or whether she was trying to fit mushed fruit into her child’s mouth that he would then vomit up, screaming.  He cried without end.  When he was not asleep, he was crying.  He was dying, and the thought of how much agony he was enduring inside of his little body gutted the mother.  She was helpless and could do nothing to alleviate the suffering.

But she could not accept this.  How could she?

In their shared pain, she wished only that she could connect to him on some emotional level.  But the delirium and suffering severed the connection.  They were apart despite being together, despite being the only two people in each other’s lives.  In the same confines they lay, their hearts universes apart.

Few and far between she had fantasies of the life that they could have shared together.  Before his first breath of air, he was a bundle of potential.  But now he was a carcass ticking.  Her precious child, so beautiful and without impurity, was begotten from death.

She had lived an honest life.  She had done everything right.  She had never lived for herself.  And for this, she was granted her hellscape.  Because the universe is fundamentally opposed to the human virus which arrived at its doorstep.

The mother just so happened to be a target of metaphysical animosity.  A conduit of hate.

On many occasions she sat by her child’s bed while he drifted in and out of consciousness, contemplating such things.  She drew closer to him, put her hand on his tiny head pockmarked with scars from the pox.  She brought her head close to his, brushed her cheek against his, wet his face with her tears.

“I love you,” she said.  “I will always love you.”

It was not meant to be like this.  But it was.

Itching at the peripheries of her brain was the unnameable feeling of self-preservation.  That distinct human selfishness.  The thought of relief - those guilty thoughts of how much better off she would be if the son was simply dead.  Yet she thought that she could not live without him.  Indeed, when he died, she would hang herself shortly thereafter.

In life and in death, they were meant to be together.  It was fated.

The span of nine months felt like an eternity.  In those months, the mother felt like she had existed in a plane of torment that lasted millennium.  For in this domain, time was nothing but a marker of decay.  Time flowed forward only to rot the human soul.

On the tenth month, the atmosphere in her life had changed.  For the first time is as long as she could recount, she sat under a warm sun.  A cool, ethereal breeze caressed her skin and the sound of birds chirping could be heard in the distance.  It was as if the conglomeration of all that the mother and child had endured together had bent back in on itself and sent them in the reverse direction.

The horses carrying their carriage plodded onward quite consistently, causing a consistent bump that grounded the mother as she sat in her wooden seat.

The smile that she had not seen since the boy’s birth was made animate once more.  She felt as if the giant boulder that had been crushing her, wringing out her insides, had been lifted.  She felt as if she had grown wings, that she had flew far into the sky with the clouds and the birds.

She felt joy.  She was happy.  Yet, tears streamed from her eyes as she looked at her son.

“You know, I always wanted to show you the outside.  It’s so beautiful around our house.  I always thought that you’d like it, especially during the spring.”

The light shone brightly on the tiny coffin that sat behind her in the carriage.

“My angel.  I’m so happy that we can finally be together like this.”

She looked down, her eyes hollow, her hands clasped, and the carriage continued onward through the shadowed valley leading to the hall of suicide.
