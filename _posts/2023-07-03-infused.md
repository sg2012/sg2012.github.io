Noise cancelling headphones are not enough to block this world out.  They are designed for low-frequency background noise, such as that of an airplane or a lawn mower.  I've yet to own a pair that can cancel out the rancid cackling of voices.  Or the sonorous landfill of modern music blasting at full volume while I sit at a cafe.

It's a distraction.  People are unable to exist without its presence.  They cannot sit in quiet, they cannot exist among one another in silence.  As soon as they tune out of the high-stimulation frequency, the thoughts and emotions they have been suppressing begin to rear themselves like shit in the colon.  And they don't want that; it's terrifying and messy when it comes out, isn't it?  Best to ignore such aspects of life.

A perfect concoction.  Hide everything.  Don't think.  Numb yourself.  Ignore.  Never venture past the surface; the demons that are inside would tear you to pieces.

These are the only things that I hear from the autotuned noise that emantates from the speakers.  I wish they would die, just as I wish the surface of everything would be demolished so they could spill their innards and make us all drown.
