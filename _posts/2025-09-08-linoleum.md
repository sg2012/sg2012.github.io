Surrounded by jaundiced lighting, the linoleum walls peel around me.  My perception is foggy and shrouded in shadows, as if I’ve taken a third-person perspective atop my existence, an out of body narration.  It’s unclear to me if I’m dreaming or if I’ve been in a habitual loop for so long that it merely seems like a dream.

<!--more-->

Not a day has gone by that I haven’t found myself eating at this sepia-toned establishment.  I draw this conclusion based on how easily my eyes scan the menu in recognition, how it feels like the decrepit chair that I sit in is a part of me.  

The only way I can really describe this experience is that it feels particularly dirty in a liminal, domestic way, reminiscent of times in the past when institutions were celebrated and societal roles were carried out with religious fervor.  Just as I have done at any point in the historical timeline I’ve found myself in, I’ve been a passive observer rather than a participant.  People enact their script out there, beyond my boundaries.  I can see it but I cannot touch it.

The food is dirty and flavorless and lukewarm.  Gooped atop dull, white dishware, a long, curly hair plastered beneath the pasta’s cream sauce like a parasitic infection, it provides no sustenance.  I eat it regardless, forking my way around the uninvited keratin oppressor.  It’s difficult to swallow; the weight of this decaying atmosphere is pressed down upon myself and the other patrons in this place whom I cannot fully make out.  Their chatter is obvious, and so are their outlines.  But their faces remain obscured behind a blurry veil.  

They might as well be replicas of the stale smelling table that I sit at.

This place is nothing but filth.  Grimy, yellow, filth.

“Anything else for you?”

The voice stunned me.

The waitress was wearing a dress of black and white.  Something about her seemed more human than the rest.  Perhaps it was her facial expression.  She way that her mouth curved upward with her eyes seemed genuine.  Yes, she smiled with her whole face.  And because of that, I felt like I knew her.

I don’t remember the last time that I had to talk.  It’s as if I’ve forgotten.  “Just the check.”  I stumble my words, but manage to extract them from my brain.  My proclamation sounds more like a question than a statement of fact.

She looks me in my eyes and nods.

A few minutes later, another plate is placed in front of me, this one smaller.  I feel her presence behind me.

“I didn’t order this.”  The piece of cake seemed to stare at me.

“It’s my treat,” she says.  “I hope you enjoy it.”

I cut into the dessert with my fork.  The slice stopped midway, coming up against some sort of resistance.  My eyes widened and I feel a pang in my chest, ripping me from the subconscious spell I’ve been under for years.  Methodically, I move some remnants of cake out of the way to investigate what had stopped the utensil in its tracks.

A small, yellow slip of paper juts from the cake.  I can only make out the end of the message, written in black ink.  A long time.

A chill runs down my spine.  I quickly turn around.  The waitress is nowhere to be found.  Only the vague impression of other patrons going about their dinner in the dimly lit corridors, frozen in time.

My hand quivers as I reach down.  I tug at the note and it slips from the cake with a splish.

I’ve know you for a long time.

The wound left by the excised note in the cake oozes a bloody liquid and faintly gurgles, as if it were a body that had been cut open.  I bent my head down closer to inspect.  Only when my face had gotten a few inches away did I discern the true composition of the cake.  It seems to mouth the words to me.

I freeze.  An emission of nausea overwhelms me.  Petulant nerves rise from my stomach and into my teeth, numbing them.  Suddenly, I realize that I’m awake.  And by this I don’t mean that I was dreaming beforehand necessarily, but only that I was existing in a state below normal levels of consciousness.

I toss the piece of paper onto the plate and stand up.  The cake is beginning to stink of fermented corpse.  My chair scrapes against the wooden floor, creating a sound that rips through the dingy joint.  Momentarily, the inconspicuous chatter ceases.  I can feel the gaze of the other patrons, even if I cannot make out their eyes or the expressions on their blank faces.  I’m an awakened anomaly residing in a world of the habitually sleeping.

I am no longer a flatlined pulse.  And because of this, I feel fear for the first time in as long as I can recall.  How helpless one feels in the face of fear, the destroyer of all.

My wrinkled suit drinking the beads of neurotic sweat from my body, I shuffle from the restaurant with a mild limp.  It seems that at some point, I had injured my leg.  When or how was unclear.  One thing was certain, however: the entrance to my vehicle could not reveal itself quickly enough.  I had parked it too far away in the gravel road.  Nearly hyperventilating, I sit in the driver’s seat after what feels like an eternity of being exposed in the darkness and uncanny whispers of the night.

My jaw clenches.  The cadaverous smell still lingers in my nose.

I’ve known you for a long time.

That smile.

I jump from my seat when I hear the boom of a knock on my window.  That peculiar presence which had intruded upon my psyche crawls up my throat and licks my brain.  My neck stiff and eyes wide, I dare not turn, for I feel as if doing so would be my demise from whatever state I currently exist in.

A knock again, this time louder, this time reverberating in my soul.

I swallow.  My arms will not move to put my keys in the ignition.

I hear her voice.  “Hey you!  Open up!”

Unblinking and with the speed of forever itself, I crane my head to turn and face the feminine voice of a witch.

Her smile again, this time staring at me from outside of my window.  She still wears her work clothes, perhaps having just now gotten off her shift.

“Roll down the window!”  She gestures with her hands in an odd way.

Behind her, a van is lit up inside.  Other faces stare in my direction to see what the woman is doing.  Her acquaintances I surmise.  A blond woman in the back and two men in the driver’s seat.  The driver seems particularly disengaged, as if he was used to such antics displayed by the waitress.  The blond woman wears a scowl.

“Well?”  Her voice grows louder.  I wish she would go away.  She’s overly incessant and my fear is beginning to shift to animosity.

Something stirs within me and I do the unthinkable.

“What do you want?” I ask after the window is rolled down.

“You should come with us.”

“What are you talking about?”

“Look, don’t take this the wrong way, but you seem lonely.  I’ve seen you so many times sitting at that table alone.  And you have this, I don’t know, sad look on your face I guess.  But you seem nice.  So I thought I’d introduce you to my friends.  You know, get you out of your shell or whatever they say.”

I pause, taken aback.  Who is this person?  I swallow.

“No,” I manage.  “I want nothing to do with you or your friends.”

I begin rolling the window up and she puts her hand down as to stop it.

“Better not keep going or you’ll crush my hand and damage your window!”

“Then get your hand out,” I say, now raising my voice more than I’m used to.

She doesn’t budge.  In fact, she looks at me with a pugnacious smirk.  My heart begins beating faster.  I despise the feeling of intrusion.  And she seems to be worming her way in, no matter the cost.  I think that perhaps I’ll crush her hand and drive off.  The thoughts rush through my mind, granting me a momentary burst in adrenaline.  But alas, these are nothing more than fantasies, and I am asleep in this world.  My body cannot be willed to action.  

It never could.

I stop rolling the window up.  My mind conjures another plan, one of temporary appeasement.  Just a few minutes, I think.  I’ll talk with them, pretend to be cordial, and then I can be about my way.

“Ok,” I manage.  She seems to sense the resignation and backs up so I can vacate my car.  By the time I’m out, she’s already halfway in the large van, looking back at me over her shoulder, her eyes draped with black, straight strands of hair.

“Wait.”  I stop her.  “Did you leave a note in my food?”

She looks at me in confusion.  What’s disturbing to me is that it seems like genuine confusion.

“No,” she says, her confusion turning to faint laughter.  “But if you got a note in your food, you should’ve gotten your money back.  Doesn’t seem sanitary.”

That entire establishment is unsanitary, I think.  Grimy, yellow, decrepit decay.  But it’s my fault for returning.

My suspicions temporarily abated, I climb inside of the van.  Prodding at my gut, ever so faintly, is a peculiar feeling that all of this was meant to happen.  What that means, exactly, I cannot say or expand upon in any meaningful way.

Before I’m fully submerged in their van’s large compartment, I catch a glimpse of the black hole of a sky, notice how it is absent of stars and stripped of a moon, how it resembles an incomprehensible miasma swallowing the world that I stand on.  For a mere moment, a sense of arcane horror feels like it explodes from my very marrow and I am paralyzed by the sepsis.  Lasting a millisecond and an eternity at once, I find myself orienting back toward bodily instinct, my legs moving as if another entity is pulling the tendons.

I live and breathe, but against my wishes.

The inside of the van is quite large and worn out, several of the seats covered in torn fabric exposing a stained foam material.  The blond woman, after peering at me for a moment, offers me a beer from a case by her side.  I open it and took a sip.  No one has said anything yet, and I’m beginning to feel even more uncomfortable.

“Thanks for joining us,” the waitress said, breaking the silence, her voice emanating from behind me, near the door.

I say nothing and take another sip of the beer.  The waitress climbs in the van and shuts the door behind her with a loud clank.  She should not have closed the door.  Why would she do that?  We’re not going anywhere.  

All at once, the group begins laughing.  My hair stands on its ends and my stomach is pierced with anxiety.  I freeze, my bloodshot eyes delirious with fear.  Amidst their incongruous cackles, the driver shifts the van out of ‘park’ and slams on the gas pedal, the old engine whirring to life.  The acceleration is overwhelming, and with a jolt I’m thrown back, my beer spilling every which way.  

By the time I smack the floor of the vehicle, I realize that they plan to end my life.

I scramble back to my feet and push the waitress to the side before she can try to restrain me.  I hurl the half-full beer bottle at the windshield and it explodes into several pieces.  Shards of glass shatter with force into the face of the driver, eviscerating his eyes.  With blood pouring from his sockets, he shouts in agony and lets off the gas as to not spin out of control.  The vehicle slows.

My chance to escape has revealed itself.  I feel arms wrap around me from behind.  It’s her, screaming obscenities in my ear, revealing a psychotic side that I knew lurked under the surface.  I elbow her in the stomach and she loosens her grip momentarily, just enough for me to grab another beer bottle which I smash on the hardened middle compartment between the seats, creating a makeshift weapon of glass.

The blond woman draws a gun from under her seat, a high caliber revolver, and my heart pounds.  With reflexes manifested from the fear of imminent death, I thrust the sharp glass into her throat before she can bring her arm up.  Blood sprays like a fountain and she begins gurgling.  She drops the weapon and brings her hands up to her neck in vein; she will not survive this one.

The waitress is hysterical and lunges at me.  I leap for the other side of the van, past the blond, and fling her door open, nearly falling on the floor from the momentum.  Whisps of cool air brush against my face.

I sprint for my car and then start the ignition as past as possible.  

I step on the gas.

My trajectory narrowly misses the waitress who has closed in on me alarmingly fast.  As I accelerate past her, she smacks my car with her hands, emitting a bloodcurdling screech in the process that haunts my eardrums.  The blond woman’s fluids of death are smeared all over my windows with the waitress’s hands.

It’s not until roughly 15 minutes later, speeding down the highway, that I notice something peculiar.

The smears were not random.  They form a symbol on my window that I can’t quite interpret in terms of known human shapes or forms.  A lump forms in my throat and my fists tighten on the steering wheel.

Something deep within myself, something that should never be accessed under the typical conscious experience, resonates and unfurls itself in a blackened form.  A primordial intuition overcomes me, the noxious substrate seeping into my nerves with a cold resonance.

I’ve been marked.


The days pass like fluid dripping through an IV.  

In retrospect, what had occurred now seems like a dream within a dream, or a hallucination.  I observe the familiar art on my apartment unit’s wall, I feel the rough exterior of my living room couch under my fingers.  All is back to normal.  All is back to the way that it has been since the beginning of time.  My memories are looping, their weight collapsing inward.  My mind is empty.  My experience of myself has dissipated, slipped from a clinging grasp.  Once more, I shift into a state of delirium where waking moments are rotted by time’s linearity.

I awake one night in a profuse sweat, nearly hyperventilating, as if someone was smothering me with a pillow while I slept.  

Blackness coats my room, winds itself around my walls and through my opened door, smears itself onto my closed curtains.  Shivering in the cold from the rapidly cooling sweat pooled under me, I lift my covers with a quivering hand and manage to stand up, wobbly from the dream’s inertia.

Out of instinct, I make my way to the kitchen.  Nothing but silence.  By this time, my eyes are adjusting to the dark.  I open the fridge and take out a water bottle.  There I stand, drinking to soothe my parched throat.  I put the bottle back in the fridge.  Nothing is out of the ordinary, and I’ve managed to calm down and reacquaint myself with my pseudo-waking world, although my naked body shivers from the dampness targeted by the air conditioning blasting ice from overhead.  It’s whirring is the only sound that I can hear.  

For several seconds I stand before realizing that I can’t seem to will my body to turn back around.  A nudge from my head to lead me, and I stiffen.  A movement from my foot and it sticks back into place.  The coldness shifts into anger as I become irritated by this strangeness.  With all of my strength, I jerk my body around and fall to the floor.  A success.  Midway down, before I land, my eyes catch a glimpse of an aberration plastered along the end wall of my living room across the way.

The drapes seem to have changed shape.

On my hands and knees, it takes every ounce of courage I have to turn my head up once more to investigate.  I hope the darkness is doing an illusory dance with my perception.  

I breathe deeply and then shift my gaze upward.

The curtains in front of the window on the right have assumed a different shape.  Instead of being a rectangle to match the window, it appears that one side is distorted, as if it’s grown a tumor.

My eyes adjust further and in dismay I realize what the shape resembles.

“Get out!” I scream.  “I can see you, now get out!”

Silence.

I scramble up and leap toward the drawers in my kitchen.  From my collection of knives I draw the longest, sharpest one available.

Slowly at first, I plod forward.  “Get out, or I will kill you,” I say with a raised voice.

Still silence, and not even the slightest shift of the humanoid outline.  Panic is beginning to set in.

I begin running toward the window in a frenzy, my arm raised, the knife cocked.  While only a few feet away, in a mere instant, the humanoid behind the curtains dissipates with what sounds like an explosion, as if spacetime had warped and transported it elsewhere.  My ears ring.  Dazed, I feel blood dripping from my left ear.  I hear a cackle behind me and the sound of the voice makes my testicles recede into my body.

Pivoting my body in the reverse direction, I see that the blackened form now stands behind a lamp.  The combination of the figure and the lamp creates a sort of illusory and uncanny monstrosity.

“I was only trying to help you, and look what you did,” she says.  The voice of the waitress.  My body freezes in abject terror.

A dark hand rises from her side, the distorted hand reaching for the light switch on the lamp.  With a click, the entirety of the apartment is illuminated.  She stares at me, her eyes covered with no eyelids.  She smiles at me, her mouth no longer covered with lips.

The stench of infection hits me all at once.  I feel vomit rising in my throat.

“You’re mine now.  And you can do nothing about it.  I’m inside of you forever.”

Another explosion as she hits the switch with elongated fingers, causing her form to vacate.  A stabbing pain in my eyes causes me to crumble to the floor.  I scream in agony.  It feels as if glass shards have been forced into my sockets.  This goes on for several moments until I begin to calm down, the feeling faintly lingering as if I’d just woken from a night terror.  I rush to the bathroom and turn on the lights.  My eyes are extraordinarily bloodshot.  It looks as if blood is pooling beneath the whites.  I turn on the rest of the lights in the house and inspect each and every corner.

There is nothing to be found.  It’s as if she was never there.  A feeling of insanity washes over me, and I quickly realize that the boundaries delineating reality from fiction are absent in my mind.  Fatigue overcomes me, and back into my bed I slide, hoping that my eyes do not open again.

I’m awakened partially from the sun rays peeking through my curtains, but mostly from a horrific stinging sensation coming from my chest.  It feels like I’ve become the target of an autopsy.  Before I look down to inspect my body, a flashback of her face appears in my brain, and a feeling that what I saw was not a hallucination becomes a certainty inside of me.  She is real, she has followed me home.  And somehow, she’s inside.  Both inside of my physical space and inside of the labyrinth of my mind.  I feel contaminated.

My hand moves to inspect the sensation along my sternum.  I wince in pain as a finger makes contact with something foreign stuck to my body.  I panic, because what I hit does not feel like flesh.

It feels like plastic.

I jump from my bed and run to the bathroom mirror.  The air leaves my body when I see my reflection.

A vertical row of plastic buttons, like one would see on a dress shirt, is transposed onto my flesh.  Irritated, raw, and caked with dried blood, the buttons are sewn within my flesh.

I avert my eyes and begin pacing around my bathroom.  I’m going mad.  My brain is unable to process what it sees.  I feel like a worm is inside of me, and I can’t get it out.  

It needs to come out.

I look down at my chest.  With my thumb, I dig into the underside of the button and tug.  It hurts like fucking hell.  I gasp and then hold my breath and tense my frame.  It feels like whatever material was used to sew it into my flesh is burrowed deep.  Perhaps even past my bone and into my organs where it’s found a home.

I pull hard, ripping the button from my flesh.  My lungs feel like they’re being violently molested.  The button finally gives way with a snap, leaving some of the stringy material undoubtedly lodged deep within my torso.  I inhale for breath, my eyes watering, my body on the verge of a panic attack that feels like it might kill me.  But the thing has been extracted.

The button lay on my sink, covered in blood.  I bring my head in to inspect it and stare in disbelief.  The stringy material used to sew the button in place is not comprised of fabric.

It’s hair.  Human hair.

The color and texture elicit an atrocious memory.

That blackness.  It’s hers.

It’s her hair.  

Embedded deep within my body.

Caressing it.

Claiming it.

Smothering it.

Contaminating it.

I see her lipless smile and a frenzy overtakes me.  Violently I rip the remainder of the buttons from my body.  Blood drips down my stomach, runs down my legs and onto the white tile floor.  

After bandaging my wounds, I head to the kitchen for a glass of water, which at this point is sorely needed.  Trapped inside of my head, I barely notice my surroundings, and it’s not until I grab the handle on my refrigerator and several yellow sticky notes dislodge and fall down that I realize what has occurred while I slept.

The entire kitchen is a collage of notes.  It’s covered from top to bottom.  Hundreds and hundreds of them, scrawled with psychotic scribbles.  My heart beats out of my chest and I go numb as I scan the writing.

You fucking killed her you cunt, and now you’re going to die the most painful death imaginable.

*She will never come back, and I’ll make sure you never come back in return.*

*I’m going to slit your throat you disgusting fuck.*

*I’ll rip your intestines out and squeeze the digesting shit into your mouth while you bleed out.*

Each note is unique.  Not a single one is repeated.  Instead of any known human vernacular, several have a language alongside symbols that I cannot make out, but nonetheless appear blatantly profane.  I feel as if I’m not meant to look at them, like eyes were ever meant to see what I’m seeing.  Trying to interpret them conjures the beginnings of insanity.

After several minutes of bewilderment, it dawns on me.  The entire time that I was asleep, she invaded my domain; she had breached my perimeters.  She made all of these notes.  She had violated me, sewed the buttons into my flesh.

Strands of her hair wiggle inside of me.  I can feel them slithering around.  In both waking life and in sleep, she is with me.

I collapse to the floor and lose consciousness.


Each night she returns, and each night I am terrorized.  I am the only one who can see her, I’m sure of it.  The murky faces of the people on the outside only stare at me, lacking any recognition for my existence.

I am alone.  Deeply and utterly alone.  I always have been.

My realities of day and night bleed into each other, becoming a conglomeration of un-perception.  I awake to a dream.  I dream that I am awake.  My psyche becomes a formless, weightless substance tumbling through the blackened miasma above.  My personality and memories fracture and split and recombine into distorted perversions.  I become decentralized, parts of myself severed.  Lost.  A feeling of overwhelming loss and mourning for who I once was pick at my bones like scavengers.  There is nothing left.  There is nothing behind my eyes.

Only emptiness.

I wish I had let them kill me that night.  After all of this time, what have I been living for, anyway?  To what end is my consciousness pushed?  And where am I?

All I’ve ever known was that jaundiced lighting, that dirty food that I mindlessly consumed, and now, I know incessant violation.

The end draws nigh for me.  I can feel it in my stomach.  For my last night in this world, I settle into my bed and attempt to relax, to gain some sort of peace amidst the nightmare that is my life.  I think that if I can create this little pocket for myself, even against the blight of this onslaught, then I have redeemed myself in some insignificant way.

I don’t need to open my eyes to know that she is there, looming by my doorway.

“I think you’ve endured quite enough,” she cackles, her voice siphoned through several layers of evil.

The scissors by her side open and she plods toward me.

“Afterall, I am your savior.  I’ve known you for a long time, now.  I’ve known you ever since I gave birth to you.”

In her voice, I can hear the synthesis of them all.  Everyone I’d known and had forgotten about since drifting into my infinite hellscape.

Stunned, I open my eyes in dismay, and try to say something.  But it is no use.

My body is paralyzed, my voice is cauterized, and I cannot even scream when she cuts off my cock and balls, snuffing me from this plane.
