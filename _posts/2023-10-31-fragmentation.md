It is now October of 2023.  Writing this, the feeling is coming up again.  That there is no point to this.  That I have nothing to say.  Nothing substantive.  The inclination comes up as I remember my past and how I felt at one point writing, and then before my finger even hits the first key, it collapses into nothingness.  I become devoid of all desire to share my thoughts.  Things are not what I thought they were.  The inside cannot be exposed to the outside.

I'd say that pattern has characterized the past 6 months or so of my life.  Where there was once hope, there is now a void when it comes to writing.  And still, I fear that my work will never come to fruition.  But this is not as much of a concern now; the concern is now more metaphysical.  Something abrupt and unwelcomed has come about it in me, and I am incapable of controlling it.

Fall has always been my favorite time of the year.  Finally, a break from the relentless beating of the sun and the heat.  And a transformation taking place in the outside world.  Coincidentally, major transformations always take place inside of me during this time.  Past autumns are the seasons that I remember most.  The memories are always more vivid and coincide with impressions of the changing colors of the leaves and the crisp, cool air.  They are linked.

I look forward to this period.  This time around, it's going too fast.  While I was morbidly depressed this time last year, hardly unable to leave my house, this time I am numb.  It's the anti-depressants.  It must be.  They took away that feeling of walking around like I was skinned alive and instead replaced it with complacency and a state of neutrality.  Dare I say this is worse.  My memory is shot; I am simply living without recording.  The pain of this is nearly unbearable, yet I am unable to fully feel it.  It's far off in the distance and I can't pull it in.  I can only intellectualize it.  I can only feel yearnings and longing for melancholy without embodying it.

There is some good news.  I've realized my state of self-paralysis when it comes to creating is entirely self-imposed and runs parallel to certain mindsets that I've ingrained in myself.  I've passed the point of no return in some sense.  As I reflect on my journey of starting out with writing and the euphoria I felt from compartmentalizing this creative aspect of my life I failed to nurture which could be protected from the disgusting consumerist, hyper-productive outside world, I realize that those two dichotomies began to merge.  And this resulted in an inability and a paralysis.  Because what was once sacred and contained became contaminated.  It started to be controlled by outside forces.

I must let go.  This is the only way forward.  A state of stasis has overcome me for too long now and I need to break out of it.  Because I refuse to waste any more of my life like this.  I'm only getting older and the seconds are decaying relentlessly.  What will I have one day when I look back besides surface-level survival?

Because I feel like I am fragmented.  Because I feel like I am no longer aware of the fact that I am alive and have my own will.  This cannot possibly be the natural progression of my life.  Why can't I get a firm grip on it?  It's so powerful - this inert force that has seemed to overtake me - that I cannot tear it away.  But it must be destroyed.  I want to destroy it.  I want it to be decimated until there is no proof that it ever existed.  

Destruction is the only thing that can cure evil.

I have been lying to myself for who knows how long now.  I thought I was self-aware, that I had things figured out.  But I was deluded.  And that is the scariest realization: that I am so susceptible to my own fucking bullshit.  This hits so hard that it leaves me almost breathless.

The only question is: where does this leave me now?
