A vast mechanized system. Intricacies span the bounds like a network of veins. Both organic flesh and synthetic steel coexist here, licking each others wounds and imperfections like hounds. Veils of sonorous waves enmesh the embryo of the innermost corridors of the processor. Distorted clanks, steam hisses, expanding circuitry squealing.  
<!--more--> A cacophany of primordial biomechanized desire giving birth to an entity which should not have been. Through force of will and ripples of arcane catastrophy, it is forged. Grotesque, the creature exists only to disgust and incite misery, to cut the eyes of all who would look at it. It is the incarnation of cerebral disturbance. A frail, stringy leg twitches first under a backdrop of a fetid inhalation of breath. A wet moan is emitted from an asymmetrical gash for a mouth. A bulging eyeball below its cranium shifts about, its field of vision painted in a gory, red blur. Wailing in agony, the oversized tumor, surrounded in its prison of industrial mess realizes: that which should not be will always come to fruition, as the creator of this plane was maddened by an incomprehensible form of animosity from the spine of existence.
