# Naming the Unnameable

Naming concepts constrains their true nature.  It brings it down to the level that can be categorized which strips it of its raw implementation.  To really know these things, you have to go beyond mentalization.  The information needs to inhabit your body.  You have to feel it take root at a visceral level.  Once this happens, it stays with you.

The themes written below have appeared again and again in my own work.  It's hard to say where they exactly came from, but I seem to be attuned to them.  It's a sort of subconscious expression of patterns.

# Concepts

### `Somatrauma Contact`

The intimacy that occurs when two people love one another and have shared memories, and one of them is gravely wounded in some irreparable and highly destructive way.  The moments when they realize that there is no going back, that things will end horrifically, but there is a sense of still trying, of total denial of reality because due to feelings that transcend logic spurring them on in a reactive way.  Falling apart, bleeding, destroyed and broken, trying to put things back together that won’t go together, trying to stop bleeding that can’t be stopped.  The intense eye contact, the tears and screaming, the devastation that comes along with form being shattered.  It’s the inability to let go and a way for the will to confront the physical world and what the physical world took from them.  In that moment they become aware of the pathetic condition of their physicality and suffer from their core essence/soul being trapped within a delicate and easily wounded prison.  They question what part of them is their body vs. What is the part of them that exists beyond their body.  Even if they survive, there will be permanent deformity and scars that remind them that they will never be the same; the physical scars echo the scars on their soul.  There is a pathetic effort in trying to put flesh and muscle back where they belong and it falling out again, a pathetic effort in trying to “push” the intestines back where they should be once the sheathing is ripped apart, all done while making physical and emotional contact with the one who was harmed.  It’s this summation of all sensory and emotional domains amongst two people in a specific context which give rise to the metaphysical phenomenon of somatraumatic bonding between them.
> Key Ideas

- The crossroads between trauma and intimacy
- Grief merged with bodily destruction
- Refusal of entropy
- Confronting ruin as an act of resistance rooted in denial
- Shared human-ruination

### `Tragic Infectionism`
This one is highly personal and inward; it involves only the self.  It’s the internal experiential narrative and collection of mental, emotional, physical experiences that accompany self-decay and self-fracture which cannot be cured or reversed.  It’s the taking over of an organism’s own biology by something alien.  An infection which penetrates the host and begins making its home within the host.  Their form is destroyed and replaced, but slowly, in a way that they can observe and have to deal with at every waking moment.  It’s the feeling of violation, of the inability to keep something out, of a power that cannot be understood or stopped leaching the innards.  There is no “cure.”  First, the physical form is destroyed and taken over painfully and slowly.  But the cascading mental effects make it such that the person’s mind is also taken over.  They realize the link between body and mind, and once their body is violated, their mind follows.  They fracture not only physically, but mentally.  Their own psychology begins collapsing and morphing under the strain of a foreign entity that seeks to inhabit them.  Their identity is peeled into multiple pieces.  The self spills outward because the barriers separating them from the outside world have been ruptured.  They know that their demise will come.  It’s been predetermined from the moment they started their transformation.  The question is: what are they going to do in the meantime while they wither away and become something else?  Day by day, the self is systematically replaced.
> Key Ideas

- A disease of both the body and identity
- Biohorror merged with spiritual violation
- Erosion
- Watching yourself disintegrate and be dominated while powerless
- You’re changing without consent, boundary breaching
- Subjective self-ruination
