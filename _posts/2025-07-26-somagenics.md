Yet, I continued on. 

Their demise was something that I swallowed and moved on from, even if hesitantly and devastatingly, for their voices, each one of their unique expressions and the way that they set their eyes upon me and the world: all were worthy symbols of the temporary sentience inhabiting them, a consciousness that went far beyond anything I thought that I would ever be capable of. They were the children that I could never have. 

Their brief existence was not a shred less meaningful to me despite its ephemerality. 

In their beautiful bodily movements and their expressive voices, they carried the sacred characteristics of life and of my unwavering, completely engulfing love for each of them. 

Destruction would have its way, of course, but in the meantime, we had a life to finally live.
