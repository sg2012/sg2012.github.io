Many years ago, I used to borderline self-annihilate with discipline.  My mind would adhere to a set of goals in my head, a singular, cohesive vision of the way that I wanted things to be.  Profusely and with obsessive fervor I would read multitudes of blog posts and books about productivity and discipline, believing that this would help me.  I was one piece of information away from undergoing a complete transformation - or so it felt.  I just had to keep digging deeper and deeper into this topic and continuously trying to live out what I had uncovered, and I would finally reach the happiness and fulfillment and control over myself that I so desired.  With the clearest delineations possible, I'd finally be the ultimate force that I envisioned in my head.

((Have I mentioned that I'm a 3?  If you know anything about the enneagram, it should be clear by now.))

There was a fantastical, mythical terminus point in my psyche that I could almost taste with each new concept that went through my sight, my hearing, my deadened heart.

A fool's errand which, besides helping me out some in my career early on, brought me no closer to contentment.  I was incredibly depressed when I wasn't busy being unable to feel any human emotions besides stress, irritation, disappointment, and discontent.
